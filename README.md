## 💖 The Heart Behind Aleya

Aleya is named after my late grandmother, who embodied care, wisdom, and gentle guidance. Like a loving "Nani" (grandmother), this small companion robot aims to bring that same nurturing presence to your workspace, helping software engineers and desk workers maintain both physical and mental wellbeing during long hours of screen time.

## 🤖 What is Aleya?

Aleya is a compact, AI-driven robot that serves as your personal health companion. Unlike impersonal apps that are easily ignored, Aleya provides a physical, interactive presence that gently reminds you to take care of yourself throughout your workday. Small and cute by design, Aleya can be placed on your desk or carried with you when needed.

### Core Values

- **Compassionate Care**: Like a grandmother's love, Aleya's reminders come from a place of genuine concern
- **Gentle Persistence**: Helpful without becoming annoying
- **Holistic Wellbeing**: Addresses both physical and mental health needs
- **Personalized Attention**: Adapts to your specific habits and needs

## ✨ Features

### Physical Health Support
- 👁️ **Vision Care**: Blink reminders, 20-20-20 rule prompts (look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes)
- 💧 **Hydration Tracking**: Water intake reminders customized to your needs
- 🧘 **Posture Monitoring**: Gentle reminders to adjust posture and avoid tech neck
- 🚶 **Movement Prompts**: Suggestions to stand and stretch at appropriate intervals

### Mental Health & Productivity
- ⏱️ **Pomodoro Technique**: Customizable work/break cycles with friendly encouragement
- 🧠 **Mindfulness Moments**: Brief meditation or deep breathing exercises during breaks
- 🌿 **Stress Recognition**: Visual and behavioral cues to detect stress levels
- 💤 **Rest Advocacy**: Encouragement to maintain healthy sleep schedules

### Interactive Experience
- 🗣️ **Voice Interaction**: Natural language processing for conversational experience
- 😊 **Emotive Expressions**: LED facial expressions to convey emotions
- 🤝 **Gestural Communication**: Simple movements to enhance engagement
- 🎭 **Personality Development**: Adapts tone and approach based on your preferences
